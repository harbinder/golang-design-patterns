Fan-out, Fan-in

Following the pipeline pattern, what happens if one of your pipeline stages is more computationally expensive and requires a longer process time?

All upstream data will be stranded, and downstream stages will be left idle.

The most intuitive solution will be to increase the number of workers where work is most hefty.

This is where the Fan-out, Fan-in pattern comes into play.

1. The fanIn function takes in a slice of channels (The fanOut function produces them)

3. At the end of the function, we spawn a separate Goroutine to wait for all Goroutines to finish and close the finalCh
4. We then return the merged channel â€” finalCh back to the main function
5. The chClosure acts as a closure to the ch in each iteration
