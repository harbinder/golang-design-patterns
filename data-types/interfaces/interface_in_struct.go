Interface Variable

	___________|_______
	|				  |

Interface Type		Interface Value

			___________|_______
			|				  |
	Concrete Type		Concrete Value

%T : used to print the concrete type of the interface value
%v : used to print the concrete value of the interface value.

### Empty Interface ###
An empty interface has no methods , hence by default all concrete types implement the empty interface.
If you write a function that accepts an empty interface then you can pass any type to that function.

##### WHY Interfaces ?
Below are some benefits of using interface.
1. Helps write more modular and decoupled code between different parts of codebase â€“
It can help reduce dependency between different parts of codebase and provide loose coupling.
2. Interface can be used to achieve run time polymorphism in golang.
RunTime Polymorphism means that a call is resolved at runtime.

###### Pointer vs Value Receiver in methods while implementing an interface in Go ######

A method of a type can either have a pointer receiver or a value receiver.
There is a caveat while pointer vs value receiver for methods of a type when that type implements an interface

1. If a concrete type implements all methods of an interface(Method-set) using value receiver,
then BOTH value and pointer of that type can be used
while assigning to that interface variable or while passing to a function which accept an argument as that interface.

2. If a type implements all methods of an interface(Method-set) using pointer receiver,
then the ONLY pointer of that type can be used
while assigning to that interface variable or while passing to a function that accepts an argument as that interface.

-- Access Concrete/Underlying types of interface variable --
The underlying variable of an interface can be accessed in two ways

 1. Type Assertion
    if val, ok := interfaceVariable.(concreteType); ok == true {

    }

 2. Type Switch
    func print(i interfaceVariable) {
    switch v := i.(type) {
    case concreteType_1:
    fmt.Println("Type: concreteType_1")
    case concreteType_2:
    fmt.Println("Type: concreteType_2")
    default:
    fmt.Printf("Unknown Type %T", v)
    }
    }
